    <h1>Scope of variables in javascript</h1></div>
    <p><b>A scope is a region of the program and broadly speaking there are three places, where variables can be declared:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Inside a function or a block which is called local variables</li>
    <li>In the definition of function parameters which is called formal parameters.</li>
     <li>Outside of all functions which is called global variables.</li>

 </ul></p>
 <h2> Variable has two types of scope:</h2>
 <ul>
        <li>Global Scope</li>
        <li>Local Scope</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Global Scope</i></h2>
    <p>A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in our JavaScript code.
    A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.
    A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use
     throughout your entire program after its declaration.</p>
    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>Local Scope</i></h2>
     <p> A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined.
      Function parameters are always local to that function. A variable can also have a local scope,
       i.e it can only be accessed within a function.They can be used only by statements that are inside that
        function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own. </p>
